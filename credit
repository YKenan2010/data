[Lyrics]

My heart rages around like an ocean in my head
Because there are so many things that I left unsaid
I can almost feel you wa-wa-walking in the distance
But I know that it's not reality
If you are echoing around
Inside these parallel dimensions
All along, know I'll find you in my dreams (I'll find you in my dreams)
I'll find you in my dreams
(Find you in my-)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Walking in the distance
That it's not reality
My heart rages around like an ocean in my head
I can almost feel you wa-wa-walking in the distance
But I know that it's not reality
If you are echoing around
Inside these parallel dimensions
All along, know I'll find you in my dreams
I'll find you in my-
Walking in the distance (distance)
That it's not reality
I'll find you in my-
I'll find you in my dreams
(Find you in my-)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
walking in the distance
That it's not reality
I can almost feel you wa-wa-walking in the distance
But I know that it's not reality

[Lyrics]

Just like the street lights lit this town
Like a fire in a blaze, gotta burn it down
Can't be afraid to live this out
We got this far don't know how
I see danger in your eyes
They know we'll burn down the night
Coming just like the sunrise
You know that we gonna light it up
Babe, tonight we gonna light it up
Babe, tonight we gonna light it up
Just like the sunrise, we gonna light it up
Now
Light it, light it up
We light it, light it up
Just like a spark that's breaking out
Can't make it stop, can't turn back now
We know that's there no room for doubt
No, we can't turn back now
I see danger in your eyes
They know we'll burn down the night
Coming just like the sunrise
You know that we gonna light it up
Babe, tonight we gonna light it up
Babe, tonight we gonna light it up
Just like the sunrise, we gonna light it up
Now

[Lyrics]

I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
Tape my eyes open to force reality (oh, no no)
Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one-way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music 'til the wick burns out
Hush
Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count 'em like the four-leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep

Stranded in the open
Dried out tears of sorrow
Lacking all emotion
Staring down the barrel waiting for the
Final gates to open
To a new tomorrow
Moving with the motion
Following the light that sets me free
Sets me free

[Lyrics]

Our empty hearts and neon lights
They're playing with my mind
Gotta get out of it tonight
I wanna run off and float

And I'll tell myself it's fine to be alone
Just to find somewhere that finally feels like home
I hate all this overthinking (oh-oh-oh-oh)
The more I swim, the more I'm sinking

Take me to a world of silver
No more heartbreaks, tears, painkillers
Take me somewhere unfamiliar
Bring me back to where we started

Get me out of now
To where we started out
Get me out of now
To where we started out

La, la, la, la, la, oh, oh
Get me out of here

Broken hearts and starting fights
Turning truths to lies
Gotta get out, stop wasting time
I wanna run off and float

And I'll tell myself it's fine to be alone
Just to find somewhere that finally feels like home
I hate all this overthinking (oh-oh-oh-oh)
The more I swim, the more I'm sinking

Take me to a world of silver
No more heartbreaks, tears, painkillers
Take me somewhere unfamiliar
Bring me back to where we started out

Get me out of now
To where we started out
Get me out of now
To where we started out

[Lyrics]

Say I'm cold-hearted
But I'm just getting started
Got my eyes on the the target
Now, now
Oh, oh, oh
'Til the battle's won
'Til kingdom come
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never run
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
They'll be calling me royalty
They say I'm dangerous 'cause I
Broke all their cages
No, I, won't sit and take it
Now, now
They left me for dead, I guess they'll never learn
Every time I break there's just more pain to burn
They'll never, never, never learn
Oh, oh, oh
'Til the battle's won
'Til kingdom come
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never run
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
They'll be calling me royalty
They'll be calling me royalty
They'll be calling me royalty

[Lyrics]

Take me in the smoke
Breathe me in and let me go
Filling the lungs inside you
In the blacker nights
Make my way into your mind
Just to know what you knew

Restless every time we start locking eyes
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lost control
Oh, it′s paradise with a nasty bite
But I'm, ah, ah, ah, I′m with the dead of the night
Let the darkness take control

Let the darkness take control
Darkness take control
May the darkness take control

Take me in the smoke
Breathe me in and let me go
Sink to your heart to find you
Open up your eyes
'Til you're blinded by the lies
So you can see what you do

Restless every time we start locking eyes
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lost control
Oh, it′s paradise with a nasty bite
I, ah, ah, I′m with the dead of the night
Teardrops on the floor
The pain is over
Feel the darkness
Take control

May the darkness take control

Here and now you're coming up to me
'Fore I'm lighting up the sky
Feel the ground shaking underneath
Tryna take me alive
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Get ready for the fallout
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't stop me now
I got no rival
I'ma find my way
Through the blood and pain
Game of survival
Any time or place
Watch 'em run away
I got no-
I'll be standing on my own
Never gonna take my thrown
I got no rival
Watch 'em run away
I got no, no, no
I got no, no, no rival
No rival
No rival
Tell them now what you gon' do
We can do this face-to-face
Reckoning is coming real soon
Doesn't matter what you say
Tryna tell you listen to the moment
Can't take mine 'cause I own it
Don't you know that I'm locked and I'm loaded?
You're out of focus
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Get ready for the fallout
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't stop me now
I got no rival
I'ma find my way
Through the blood and pain
Game of survival
Any time or place
Watch 'em run away
I got no-
I'll be standing on my own
Never gonna take my throne
I got no rival
Watch 'em run away
I got no, no, no
I got no, no, no rival
No rival
I got no, no, no
I got no, no, no rival
No rival
No rival

[Lyrics]

How could I know it would be goodbye, my love?
When did the closer forever come, my love?
All I recall was a stare that was vacant and cold
Where did the spark of warmth that once stole my soul?

It seems the glow from within your eyes is gone
I never knew they could also lie far gone
How can a heart just forget what's kept in store?
I need to know what's there in this lonely room
Good-

(-bye, my love)
(We will drift away)
(Memories of us in grey, in grey)

Goodbye, my love
We will drift away
Memories of us in grey, in grey
Holding on to [?] ties
Lost when [?] it high

Once we were within this part
Now we're part
No more desire, silent nights
We can't deny [?]
She's saying "Goodbye"
